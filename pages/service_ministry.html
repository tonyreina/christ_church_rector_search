      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">Service Ministry</p>
      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">Service and outreach form the foundation of our mission at
        Christ Church. We have a generous, giving community who truly lives into our parish motto: "Bridging Love and
        Service." A core group of volunteers meets monthly to plan the outreach efforts of the church. Our parish deeply
        believes that the call to service goes beyond financial contributions. Our team provides many hands-on
        opportunities for parishioners to heed their spiritual call to help others. Some activities are held right at
        church and others involve traveling across the bridge to meet the needs of our struggling brothers and sisters
        where they live. We connect with our Day School on service opportunities whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">Most importantly, we have fun! Our
        service is joyful and engages all ages and abilities.</p>
      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">We are active in our diocese and partner with other Episcopal
        churches in outreach activities. We have a close relationship with <a href="https://stmarks-cityheights.org/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Mark’s in City Heights</a>, a very
        small church in a low-income neighborhood that serves the homeless and low-income family, and <a
          href="https://www.stlukesnorthpark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Luke’s in
          North Park</a> that ministers to a large refugee population. Our church began a diocesan-wide Service and
        Justice Coalition several years ago that still meets quarterly and brings together outreach coordinators from
        churches and organization throughout our diocese to share ideas and collaborate. Our favorite Christ Church
        outreach events include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3 space-y-2">
        <li>Annual Spaghetti Dinner "food-raiser" to collect nonperishable foods to stock St. Mark’s Neighborhood Pantry
        </li>
        <li>An annual Mexican fiesta to raise funds for <a href="https://vjkids.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Vida Joven</a>, a foundation that supports orphanages in nearby
          Tijuana, Mexico</li>
        <li>A pie sale to raise funds for refugee children attending our diocesan summer camp</li>
        <li>A backpack drive to send low-income children off to school with everything they need to start the year right
        </li>
        <li>A Thanksgiving food drive that supports several churches in our diocese</li>
        <li>A holiday toy drive to benefit preschoolers in Head Start programs run by <a

            class="underline">Episcopal Community Services</a>.</li>
