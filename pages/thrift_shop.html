      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">One of the most significant and impactful ministries of Christ
        Church is our Thrift Shop. In operation for over 50 years, it is managed and staffed entirely by nearly 50
        volunteers. 100% of the proceeds support a wide range of parish activities and outreach efforts at
        the diocesan, national, and international levels. In 2025 alone, over $100,000 in funds were provided to
        worthwhile ministries, including Christ Church Day School, the <a href="https://sandiegofoodbank.org/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">San Diego Food Bank</a>, World Food Kitchen, PAWS
        (our
        local animal welfare group), <a href="https://vjkids.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          class="underline">Vida Joven</a> (a foundation that supports orphanages in Tijuana), <a
          href="https://refugee-net.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">The Episcopal
          Refugee
          Network</a>, and various other projects of <a href="https://edsd.org/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">The Episcopal Diocese of San Diego</a>.</p>
      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">Beyond its vital financial outreach, the Thrift Shop provides
        help to low-income families by offering quality merchandise at very low cost. It also creates
        fellowship for volunteers and shoppers who’ve developed relationships over the years. Volunteer managers and
        workers come not only from our church, but from the Coronado community at large. The shop is open for sales and
        donations on Tuesday through Saturday, 10 am to 1 pm.</p>
      <p class="text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed mt-3">The Thrift Shop embodies our call to service in tangible,
        practical ways, connecting commerce with compassion and stewardship with generosity.</p>
